### 1. Alpha helixes 
Alpha helixes are the most common protein structures.
  - Hydrogen bonds exists between the first and fourth residues of amino acid chains
  - A rise represents vertical distance between two residues
  - Different forms of alpha helixes existed and are differed by number of residues  including 3_10 helix which assume the (i,     i+3) bond type and pie-helix which assumes the (i, i+5) bond type.
