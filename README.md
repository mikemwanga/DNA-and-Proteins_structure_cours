# **DNA and Proteins Structure Course**

In proteins flow from amino to carboxy group directios. The arrows will always point to this direction.

### 1. Alpha helixes 
Bonds are **intratwained**
Alpha helixes are the most common protein structures.
  - Hydrogen bonds exists between the first and fourth residues of amino acid chains
  - A rise represents vertical distance between two residues
  - Different forms of alpha helixes existed and are differed by number of residues  including 3_10 helix which assume the (i,     i+3) bond type and pie-helix which assumes the (i, i+5) bond type.
  
  
  

### 2. Beta sheet structure
  Beta sheets bonds are **inter-twained**\
    - Exists in eaither parallel or antiparallel forms\
    - Multiple beta strucutres exists
    
 Almost all proteins are made of alpha, beta sheets joined by and loops turns 

### **Motifs**
   - Also known as folds in other authorities. Folds could be combinations of helix and helix or helix and beta sheets\
